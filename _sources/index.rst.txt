LaserPy_Quantum Documentation
=============================

Welcome to `LaserPy_Quantum <https://github.com/Mathwizard1/LaserPy_Quantum>`__

**LaserPy_Quantum** provides an intuitive interface for simulating complex laser interactions, current drivers, and interferometer setups, with plans to offload performance-critical components to Rust for high-speed numerical computations. A *high-level, open-source Python library designed for the theoretical simulation of laser systems* in quantum communication and cryptographic protocols.
